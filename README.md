## pandas-challenge 

This repository contains my solutions to Data Analytics Bootcamp Homework Assignment #4.

### Folders/Files:

"HeroesOfPymoli" (folder)
* "HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb (jupyter notebook file containing python/pandas code)
* "Resources": (folder)
** "purchase_data.csv" (input data file)

	
Notes:

The python scripts rely on relative path referencing, therefore the folders "Resources" 
and "Analysis" should not be deleted, moved, or renamed.  Also, the input files must be
present in the "Resources" folders and not be renamed.
If the output files already exist in the "Analysis" folders prior to executing the code,
they will be replaced by the new output files.
